                <p>
                <br>
                I am a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker (L.I.C.S.W.) and Certified Clinical Trauma Specialist with over 30 years of experience working with individuals and families impacted by illness, disability, and psychosocial and traumatic stress. 
                <br>
                I’m licensed in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
                <br><br>
                I have a B.A. in philosophy and a Certificate in Women’s Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as well as a master's degree from their School of Social Work, with an emphasis on mental health and illness over the life span.  Over the years I’ve also received extensive training in individual and family therapy from a number of institutions, organizations, and highly respected clinicians.

                Danish philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, claimed that, "Life can only be understood backwards but must be lived forwards.”  I believe the “best” therapy takes advantage of our natural impulse to seek meaning by looking backward and forward, as well as inward and out, and in service of a preferred future and a preferred self.

                A client's right to self-determination is a core value within the social work profession.  Consequently, my therapeutic relationships with clients are collaborative. 
                <br><br>
                I offer EMDR, clinical hypnosis, and relaxation techniques to treat the effects of traumatic and chronic stress, and I incorporate a life-span development, family systems, and a social context perspective.   I also welcome into therapy the use of personal reflection, story, intuition, art, dreams, history, and community relationships.
                <br><br>
                As a social worker, I’m trained to embrace a psychosocial, 'person-in-environment' perspective that emphasizes the interplay between individual characteristics and social context when examining life problems.
                <br><br>
                Scientific research over the past few decades confirms the importance of a 'person-in-environment' approach to therapy, as up to 70% of the determinants of health are outside of an individual's control.  (show pie graph of social determinants)
