                <h3>Is living organ donation safe?</h3>

                <p>The purpose of this website is to share information about living organ donation that has been gathered from various open sources.</p>
                <br>
                <p>According to the World Health Organization, the social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. Research has demonstrated that up to 70% of the determinants of health are outside of an individual's control. Therefore, these social determinants impact everyone, including living organ donors (click here for source).</p>

                <p>Living organ donation is more than a one-time surgical event. It has both short and long-term meaning. It’s best understood as a series of interactions that take place within a (1) social and economic context that includes commercial, non-profit, medical, governmental, and international organizations -- and (2) the donor’s personal sphere of family, friends, and community.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The information provided on this website reflects our attempt to highlight many variables that impact living organ donors before, during, and after donation.  And, although beyond the scope of this website, it’s important to recognize that the epidemic of organ failure and the need for organ replacement therapies are also mediated by social factors.</p>
